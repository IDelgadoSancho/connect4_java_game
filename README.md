## Connect 4 in Java

### Technologies used:

- **JAVA**: A general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.

Connect 4 is a two-player strategy board game where the goal is to align four same-color tokens in a row, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a vertical board.

Players alternate turns inserting a token into any column, and the token falls to the lowest available position. The first to connect four consecutive tokens wins.

The program starts by asking the user to enter the board dimensions:

The program includes validation in case the player tries to enter rows or columns below the minimum:

When the game starts, the board is displayed first, along with a message showing the current player's turn and prompting for the column number to drop the token:

Validation is also included if the player enters a non-existent column, for example (-1):

The program checks if a token is placed in a full column:

It also detects if the board is full; in that case, the game ends in a DRAW:

After a DRAW or when a player manages to connect four tokens, the console asks whether the players want to restart the game or not.

If an invalid command is entered for “yes” or “no,” it will prompt again:

The winner message shows which player has won:
